# Final Analysis Summary: Reciprocals Hypothesis

**Research Question**: Are reciprocals (*each other*, *one another*) better classified as fused determinatives rather than pronouns?

## Key Findings

### 1. Primary Hypothesis Test ‚ùå REJECTED
- **Method**: Permutation test with clustering analysis
- **Result**: 1/2 reciprocals closer to fused determinatives (50% = random chance)
- **P-value**: 0.545 (not significant)
- **Effect size**: 0.009 (essentially zero)
- **Conclusion**: No evidence for fused determinative classification

### 2. Model Comparison ‚ùå REJECTED
- **Method**: Cross-validation classifier comparison
- **Result**: Traditional classification (pronouns) fits better
- **Log-likelihood difference**: 0.0124 in favor of pronoun classification
- **Individual predictions**: Both reciprocals predicted as pronouns (71%, 69%)

### 3. Feature Analysis ‚ö° MIXED EVIDENCE
- **Morphological features**: Mixed patterns
- **Semantic features**: Reciprocals ‚Üí pronouns
- **Syntactic features**: Reciprocals ‚Üí fused determinatives ‚≠ê
- **Key finding**: Reciprocals genuinely intermediate, not clearly either category

### 4. Visualization Insights üìä **CONVERGENT EVIDENCE**
- **MCA biplot**: Reciprocals cluster clearly with pronouns (standard linguistic method)
- **Jaccard PCoA**: Same pattern - reciprocals group with pronoun cluster (dialectometry standard)  
- **Distance heatmap**: Confirms numerical analysis
- **Pattern**: Multiple visualization methods converge on pronoun classification

## Scientific Assessment

‚úÖ **Methodological Rigor**
- Pre-registered hypothesis and analysis plan
- Simulation testing to avoid false positives
- Multiple convergent analytical approaches
- Documented post-hoc analyses ("forking paths")

‚úÖ **Transparent Reporting**
- Honest reporting of negative results
- Strong prior against hypothesis properly weighted
- Alternative interpretations considered

## Theoretical Implications

1. **Cambridge Grammar classification validated** for this feature matrix
2. **Reciprocals show genuine intermediate status** - neither purely pronouns nor determinatives
3. **Syntactic vs semantic dissociation** - different feature types show different patterns
4. **Fusion-of-functions framework** may apply but needs different operationalization

## Conclusion

The hypothesis that reciprocals are fused determinatives is **not supported** by this linguistic feature matrix. However, the analysis reveals reciprocals have **genuine intermediate grammatical status**, showing syntactic properties of fused determinatives while maintaining semantic properties of pronouns.

This suggests the grammatical reality may be more complex than either traditional classification captures.
