   fused_determinative: 0.000 (n=6)
   reciprocal: 0.500 (n=2)
   pronoun: 0.000 (n=63)

2. each (variance: 0.046)
   other_determinative: 0.015 (n=67)
   fused_determinative: 0.000 (n=6)
   reciprocal: 0.500 (n=2)
   pronoun: 0.000 (n=63)

3. another (variance: 0.045)
   other_determinative: 0.030 (n=67)
   fused_determinative: 0.000 (n=6)
   reciprocal: 0.500 (n=2)
   pronoun: 0.000 (n=63)

4. any (variance: 0.045)

RECIPROCAL DETAILED COMPARISON
============================================================
Gelman: 'What exactly makes reciprocals different (or not)?'

Reciprocals found: ['each_other', 'one_another']
Fused determinatives: ['anybody', 'anyone', 'anything', 'everything', 'somebody', 'someone']
Pronouns: 63 items

--- each_other ---
Nearest neighbors:
  1. one_another (reciprocal) - distance: 2.236
  2. tonight (pronoun) - distance: 4.243
  3. today (pronoun) - distance: 4.359
  4. themselves (pronoun) - distance: 4.583
  5. everything (fused_determinative) - distance: 4.690
Top 10 neighbors by group: {'reciprocal': 1, 'pronoun': 6, 'fused_determinative': 3}

--- one_another ---
Nearest neighbors:
  1. each_other (reciprocal) - distance: 2.236
  2. tonight (pronoun) - distance: 4.359
  3. today (pronoun) - distance: 4.472
  4. someone (fused_determinative) - distance: 4.583
  5. oneself (pronoun) - distance: 4.690
Top 10 neighbors by group: {'reciprocal': 1, 'pronoun': 5, 'fused_determinative': 3, 'other_determinative': 1}

GELMAN'S SUMMARY
============================================================
Key insights from exploratory analysis:
1. Look at the PCA plot - do you see natural clusters?
2. Check the feature distributions - what drives the differences?
3. Examine reciprocal neighbors - are they really intermediate?

Gelman: 'The data should tell a story. What story does this tell?'
