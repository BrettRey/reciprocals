=== RECIPROCALS HYPOTHESIS TEST ===
Testing: Do reciprocals pattern with fused determinatives rather than pronouns?
Strong prior: Cambridge Grammar classifies them as pronouns (85% confidence)
================================================================================

Loaded 138 linguistic items with 155 features
Found 6 fused determinatives: ['anybody', 'anyone', 'anything', 'everything', 'somebody', 'someone']
Found 6 pronouns: ['he', 'him', 'himself', 'she', 'herself', 'themselves']
Found 2 reciprocals: ['each_other', 'one_another']

Comparison groups:
- Fused determinatives: 6 items
- Pronouns: 6 items
- Reciprocals (test items): 2 items

Running permutation test (1000 permutations)...

==================================================
RESULTS
==================================================
Observed pattern: 1/2 reciprocals closer to fused determinatives
Proportion preferring fused determinatives: 50.0%
P-value (permutation test): 0.545
Mean effect size: 0.009
Distance between group centroids: 4.684

Individual reciprocal results:
  each_other:
    Distance to fused determinatives: 4.311
    Distance to pronouns: 4.298
    Closer to fused determinatives: False
    Effect size: 0.003
  one_another:
    Distance to fused determinatives: 4.349
    Distance to pronouns: 4.413
    Closer to fused determinatives: True
    Effect size: 0.014

==================================================
INTERPRETATION
==================================================
Evidence strength: very weak
Bayesian conclusion: insufficient evidence to overcome strong prior from Cambridge Grammar

Null distribution statistics:
  Mean under random assignment: 1.0/2
  Extreme results (0 or 2): 920/1000 (92.0%)
