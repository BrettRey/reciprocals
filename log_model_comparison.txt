=== MODEL COMPARISON ANALYSIS ===
POST-HOC ANALYSIS: Testing reciprocal classification schemes
FORKING PATHS: Documented in analysis_preregistration.md
======================================================================

Loaded 136 non-reciprocal items and 2 reciprocals
Features: 155 linguistic features

Training data: 73 determinatives, 63 pronouns

Cross-validation performance on non-reciprocal data:
  Mean accuracy: 0.898 ± 0.126
  Mean log-likelihood: -0.283 ± 0.208

Testing reciprocal classification schemes...

==================================================
MODEL COMPARISON RESULTS
==================================================

MODEL A: Reciprocals as DETERMINATIVES
  Overall accuracy: 0.978
  Log-likelihood: -0.111
  N samples: 138

MODEL B: Reciprocals as PRONOUNS (current)
  Overall accuracy: 0.993
  Log-likelihood: -0.099
  N samples: 138

MODEL COMPARISON:
  Accuracy difference (A - B): -0.0145
  Log-likelihood difference (A - B): -0.0124
  BETTER FIT: Model B (reciprocals as pronouns)

==================================================
INDIVIDUAL RECIPROCAL PREDICTIONS
==================================================
(Based on classifier trained on non-reciprocal data)

each_other:
  Probability of being pronoun: 0.713
  Probability of being determinative: 0.287
  Predicted category: pronoun

one_another:
  Probability of being pronoun: 0.691
  Probability of being determinative: 0.309
  Predicted category: pronoun

==================================================
INTERPRETATION
==================================================
Model fit interpretation: Model B (pronouns) fits better - supports traditional classification

CAVEAT: This is post-hoc analysis after seeing clustering results.
Results should be interpreted cautiously due to multiple testing.
Consider this exploratory evidence, not confirmatory.
